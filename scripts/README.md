# Scripts Folder

This folder contains Python scripts for the Docker Data Science project.

## Contents

- `data_prep.py`: A sample Python script for data preparation and preprocessing. This script demonstrates how to process data within the Docker environment using common data science libraries.

## Usage

Scripts in this folder can be executed:

1. From the command line within the Docker container:
   ```bash
   python data_prep.py
   ```

2. From VS Code when connected to the container
3. As imported modules in other scripts or notebooks

## Purpose

The scripts folder serves several important functions:

- Contains reusable code modules for data science tasks
- Houses production-ready implementations of analyses
- Provides utilities for data processing, model training, and evaluation
- Stores command-line tools for automation within the Docker environment

## Best Practices

- Include docstrings and comments to document functionality
- Implement proper error handling
- Use logging instead of print statements
- Structure scripts to be importable as modules when appropriate
- Consider using a structure like:
  ```python
  def main():
      # Main script functionality
      
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```
