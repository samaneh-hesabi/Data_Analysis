# Figures Folder

This folder contains images and diagrams used in the Docker Data Science project documentation.

## Contents

- `docker.jpg`: An illustration explaining Docker concepts and architecture.
- `port.jpg`: A diagram visualizing network port mapping in Docker containers.
- `volume.jpg`: An explanation of Docker volumes and how data persistence works across containers.

## Usage

These images are referenced in the main README.md to provide visual explanations of key Docker concepts. They help users better understand:

1. The relationship between Dockerfiles, images, and containers
2. How network ports function in containerized applications
3. Data persistence through volume mounting

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive filenames for images
- Ensure images are optimized for web viewing
- Provide text alternatives in documentation for accessibility
- Keep images up-to-date when concepts change
